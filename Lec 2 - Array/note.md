- when using a library, it's sometimes not sufficiently only to include the header *** #include <cs50.h> *** at your top of your code which just tell the compiler that functions you gonna use below are exist.
  --> You additionally need to tell the computer where to find the 0's and 1's that someone has written to implement a function (inside the lib)
